# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

Although I started late on 19 December, I've managed to catch up and solve 10 problems.

I've used following programming languages to solve the problems:
- Java (Days 1-4)
- Python (Day 5-10)

Java made me to create custom classes and really  while the solutions made using Python have been more concise and script-like.
